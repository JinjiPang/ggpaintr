```

## Run the shiny app

```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(ggpaintr)

```



## Development

+   location for external data: `inst/extdata`
+   location for example shiny app: `inst/shiny`
+   location for files that need to be uploaded but are not part of the package: `preconsideration/<folder_name>`
+   coding style consistency: please try to use `underscores_in_variable_names` and (maybe) `camelCase` for web-related names...
